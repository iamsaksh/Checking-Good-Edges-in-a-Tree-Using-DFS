# Checking-Good-Edges-in-a-Tree-Using-DFS
This C program identifies and counts "good edges" in a tree-like structure where each node has a parent-child relationship. The program accepts input for node values and the parent-child relationships and then checks each edge in the tree to determine whether it is a "good edge."
